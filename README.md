Analysis of product semantics
Our database contains information about numerical product ratings with text comments. I hear that modern algorithms can read and understand these reviews. Let’s implement the functionality for classifying positive/negative comments and consolidate the analytics. I’m interested in the correlation of text comments with a numerical rating (1-5), products with the best/worst reviews, sellers who only collect negative feedback. I would also like to highlight such an entity as price in the comment text, so that the analytical department looks through this information for mentions of the competitors’ prices.
